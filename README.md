# The Project
This project is a web application that displays information about the top 50 companies based on various criteria. It was built using React, JavaScript, and an Express.js backend.

# The Problem:
The main challenge of this project was fetching the relevant data from the backend API and displaying it to the user in a clear and organized manner. The application allows users to search for companies based on criteria such as location, founding year, and sector. The data fetched from the API is then filtered and displayed in a list of companies, along with individual company details.

# Technologies used:

JavaScript,
Express.js,
